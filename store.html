      <p>
        While anime fans are just beginning to enjoy the Spring 2023 season,<br />
        many are already looking forward to Summer and Season 2 of the dark<br />
        shonen juggernaut Jujutsu Kaisen. After the booming success of Season
        1<br />
        and the prequel film Jujutsu Kaisen 0, glimpses of Season 2 have been<br />
        revealed with stunning animation and more layers to the story that
        are<br />
        sure to amaze. Similar to the prequel movie, JJK's second season will
        be<br />
        another blast to the past with the focus on Satoru Gojo. Though fans<br />
        quickly grew to love Season 1's plot and characters like Yuji
        Itadori,<br />
        Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki and their classmates at Jujutsu
        High,<br />
        the upcoming "Gojo's Past" arc is important in shaping the overall
        story<br />
        in a truly original way.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The Plot and Trailer for Jujutsu <br />
        Kaisen Season 2
      </h2>
      <img src="jujutsu2.png" alt="juju" />
      <p>
        Season 2's plot will take place in 2006 and is centered around <br />
        second-year student Gojo and his mission alongside his best friend<br />
        Suguru Geto. As Jujutsu High students, they are tasked with the job
        of<br />
        escorting and protecting a young girl named Riko Amanai, who is to be<br />
        used as a Vessel for the figure known as Master Tengen. Glimpses of<br />
        younger Gojo's relationships with Geto, Riko and other classmates are<br />
        seen, as is a more vibrant energy from the younger, possibly more
        naive<br />
        version of the present-day strongest sorcerer.<br /><br />
        When the Jujutsu Kaisen anime's official Twitter channel released the<br />
        full Season 2 trailer on March 24th, and then by TOHO animation's<br />
        YouTube channel on March 25, fans were set ablaze with further
        details<br />
        on how the story is shaping up. Going further into Gojo's student
        days,<br />
        the trailer focuses on scenes with him and Geto while including hints
        of<br />
        other recognizable characters from Season 1. Younger versions of
        Shouko<br />
        Ieiri, Jujutsu High's Doctor, and possibly Utahime Iori, the Kyoto<br />
        campus teacher, are briefly shown. Fans might have overlooked their<br />
        presence in the trailer thanks to the surprise introduction of one
        Toji<br />
        Fushiguro.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Release Date <br />
        and Production Updates
      </h2>
      <img src="jujutsu3.png" alt="juju3" />
      <p>
        It's already clear that Season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen will provide more of
        <br />
        Studio MAPPA's jaw-dropping animation, with many fans comparing the<br />
        trailer's visuals and vibe to a high-budget film. MAPPA CEO Manabu<br />
        Otsuka shared his reflections on the production, stating: “We are not<br />
        going to be doing the same thing and repeat ourselves. To the fans of<br />
        the series, I would like to show even greater success and bigger
        growth<br />
        in season 2.”<br /><br />
        As for the voice actors, all those from Season 1 of Jujutsu Kaisen
        are<br />
        reprising their roles in Season 2. Takahiro Sakurai will be voicing
        as<br />
        Geto once more, while the voices of Riko Amanai and Toji Fushiguro
        will<br />
        be played by Anna Nagase (Yurei Deco) and Takehito Koyasu (Gintama)<br />
        respectively. A new director is in charge, with Shōta Goshozono
        (Ranking<br />
        of Kings) replacing Sung Hoo Park.<br /><br />
        Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 is set to premiere on July 6th, 2023. It will
        be<br />
        broadcast on television in Japan and available for streaming online
        via<br />
        Crunchyroll. For newcomers to the franchise and longtime fans wanting
        to<br />
        get caught up, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 1 and the film Jujutsu Kaisen 0
        are<br />
        both available to watch on Crunchyroll right now.<br />
